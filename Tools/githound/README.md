# GitHound

A pattern-matching, patch-attacking, batch-catching secret snatcher.

GitHound hunts down exposed API keys and other sensitive information on GitHub using GitHub code search, pattern matching, and commit history searching. Unlike other secret-finding tools, GitHound's use of of GitHub code search enables it to search all of GitHub and isn't limited to specific repos, users, or orgs.
More information is available in the [accompanying blog post](https://tillsongalloway.com/finding-sensitive-information-on-github/).

## Features

- GitHub/Gist code search. This enables GitHound to locate sensitive information exposed across all of GitHub, uploaded by any user.
- Sensitive data detection using pattern matching, contextual information, and string entropy
- Commit history digging to find improperly deleted sensitive information
- Scoring system that filters common false positives and optimizes intensive repo digging
- Base64 detection and decoding
- Options to build GitHound into larger systems, including JSON output and custom regexes

## Usage

`echo "\"tillsongalloway.com\"" | git-hound` or `git-hound --subdomain-file subdomains.txt`

## Setup

1. Download latest version of GitHound for Linux systems at https://github.com/tillson/git-hound/releases (with wget [url] or from the web browser).
2. Decompress the download with tar -xzf [filename]. You may have to navigate to the Downloads folder with `cd` first.
3. `cd` into the now decompressed folder and configure GitHound by creating a `config.yml` file (either in the same directory as the `git-hound` binary or in `~/.githound`). There's an example config [here](https://github.com/tillson/git-hound/blob/master/config.example.yml). Make sure your username and password is in "quotation marks" and that you rename the `config.example.yml` file to `config.yml`.
4. Run `./git-hound` to test (make sure you're in the correct directory!)

### Two-Factor Authentication

If GitHound is logged into your GitHub account, two-factor authentication may kick in. You can pass 2FA codes to GitHound with `--otp-code`.
Otherwise, GitHound will prompt you for it when it starts up.
You can also [supply your 2FA seed](https://github.com/tillson/git-hound/pull/24) in the config and you'll never have to worry about 2FA again.
Grab the 2FA seed by decoding the barcode that GitHub shows during the 2FA setup process.

## API Key Regexes
GitHound utilizes a database of API key regexes maintained by the [Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) authors.

## Use cases

### Corporate: Searching for exposed customer API keys

Knowing the pattern for a specific service's API keys enables you to search GitHub for these keys. You can then pipe matches for your custom key regex into your own script to test the API key against the service and to identify the at-risk account.

`echo "api.halcorp.biz" | githound --dig-files --dig-commits --many-results --regex-file halcorp-api-regexes.txt --results-only | python halapitester.py`

For detecting future API key leaks, GitHub offers [Push Token Scanning](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-token-scanning) to immediately detect API keys as they are posted.

### Bug Bounty Hunters: Searching for leaked employee API tokens

My primary use for GitHound is for finding sensitive information for Bug Bounty programs. For high-profile targets, the `--many-results` hack and `--languages` flag are useful for scraping >100 pages of results.

`echo "\"uberinternal.com\"" | githound --dig-files --dig-commits --many-results --languages common-languages.txt --threads 100`

## How does GitHound find API keys?

https://github.com/tillson/git-hound/blob/master/internal/app/keyword_scan.go
GitHound finds API keys with a combination of exact regexes for common services like Slack and AWS and a context-sensitive generic API regex. This finds long strings that look like API keys surrounded by keywords like "Authorization" and "API-Token". GitHound assumes that these are false positives and then proves their legitimacy with Shannon entropy, dictionary word checks, uniqueness calculations, and encoding detection. GitHound then outputs high certainty positives.
For files that encode secrets, decodes base64 strings and searches the encoded strings for API keys.
